Here you'll find not only the links to mp3 files that are also present in the pages dedicated to the individual CD projects, but several others as well; the music from the CDs is placed first, so if you're interested in the \"other\" material, you may want to scroll toward the bottom of the page. You'll also find detailed informations on each musical example. Please understand that I'm not allowed to put published pieces here in their entirety; plus, they are usually quite long. All files are in mp3 format, and they're given indications for duration and file size. Enjoy!","title":"Music","thumbnail":null,"timestamp":1541094900,"status":"node-status-published"}
